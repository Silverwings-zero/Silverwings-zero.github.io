## Predoctoral Graduate Researcher at University of Chicago Actuated User Experience Lab (AxLab) (Sept 2022 - Present)

In the progressive environment of the University of Chicago's Actuated User Experience Lab (AxLab), I have been exploring the dynamic rendering of 3D shapes through the project "SHAPE-IT." This initiative has bridged the capabilities of Generative AI, specifically GPT-4, with pin-based shape displays, enabling a novel approach to on-the-fly shape creation and customization. By harnessing the power of real-time language instructions, "SHAPE-IT" allows users to intuitively author shape, motion, and interaction without the necessity for pre-programmed behaviors.

## Software Engineer Intern at Kolmostar (May 2022 - September 2022)

My journey with Kolmostar led me to work on innovative solutions aimed at augmenting the signal strength of microchips in urban landscapes, thereby significantly enhancing their performance and reliability. Through simulations and 3D modeling techniques, I recreated urban environments to provide a platform for precise shadow calculations of buildings at varying times of the day. A pivotal part of my contribution was the creation of a GUI Tool, facilitating easy visualization of shadows over specified areas and a streamlined pipeline for selecting and importing desired areas.

## Lab Assistant at Georgia Tech Borg Lab (May 2021 - May 2022)

At the Georgia Tech Borg Lab, I was engrossed in a fascinating project that involved constructing a cable robot system capable of creating graffiti artwork. The project entailed setting up a Motion Capture system to capture real artists' graffiti trajectories, which were then replicated by the cable robot. A significant part of my work revolved around implementing trajectory optimization on the cable robot to solve challenges like infinite velocity, efficient area coverage, and smoothing. Additionally, I employed a Panda Robotic Arm (6 DOF) to produce Chinese calligraphy artwork, where I applied Chebyshev polynomial for stroke generation and developed a dynamic algorithm for optimizing the trajectory of calligraphy strokes.

## Lab Assistant at Aerospace Information Research Institute (Aug 2021 - May 2022)

My endeavor at the Aerospace Information Research Institute primarily involved developing a novel remote sensing image object detection model to enhance detection accuracy for rotated objects. The project saw the birth of an innovative method using a part-based unsupervised strategy, which remarkably boosted the network operation speed by nearly 93 percent and reduced the model parameters by 36.8 percent compared to previous state-of-the-art models.

## Robotics Software Solution Intern at Megvii (May 2019 - August 2019)

At Megvii, I delved into advanced motion planning for the ABB_irb_1200 robotic arm model (6 DOF). My work entailed employing Probabilistic Roadmap (PRM), A* Search, and Rapidly-Exploring Random Tree (RRT) techniques to ensure proficient obstacle avoidance and travel cost minimization. A notable accomplishment was the design and implementation of a benchmarking algorithm to compare and evaluate the efficiency of different motion planning strategies. This work not only influenced the selection and optimization of algorithms but also laid a solid foundation for future research and development in robotic motion planning.
