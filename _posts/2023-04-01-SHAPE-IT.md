## Abstract

SHAPE-IT marks a breakthrough as the inaugural AI-enabled shape display that renders dynamic 3D shapes leveraging Large Language Models. Unlike conventional shape displays requiring pre-programmed behaviors for shape and animation creation, SHAPE-IT integrates Generative AI (GPT4) with pin-based shape displays, facilitating on-demand and on-the-fly authoring of dynamic shapes. This innovative approach empowers users to dictate shape, motion, and interaction through real-time natural language inputs, bypassing the need for coding. The implementation showcases a software bridge between custom prompts for GPT4 and a Unity-based shape rendering software, generating scripts to control shape display based on user instructions. Applications extend to gaming, entertainment, on-demand teaching aids, adaptive furniture, and controllers, demonstrating a rich potential for this technology. A ten-participant user study sheds light on the promising concept and unveils insights for addressing future research challenges.

## Introduction

The foundation of SHAPE-IT lies in the visionary concept of "Radical Atoms" by Ishii et al., envisioning a clay-like material imbued with computation, morphing based on user interactions. Another influential concept is "Claytronics," providing a robotics perspective on dynamic material reconfiguration.

## Results

Key findings encompass:
- **Context Initialization:** Establishing hardware contexts is crucial to inform the system about hardware constraints such as dimensions and operational limitations like the motion range of pins, covering displays like InFORM-30x30, ShapeShift-12x24, and inFORCE-5x10.
- **Objective and Guidelines:** Though not fully detailed, this section hints at setting clear objectives and guidelines for dynamic shape rendering.

## Discussion

The discourse explores the challenges and prospects of AI-empowered shape displays, demonstrated through practical applications based on the SHAPE-IT prototype. It also reflects on related work concerning pin-based shape display, authoring methods in shape display, content generation in HCI (Human-Computer Interaction), and language-based interactions.

## Conclusion

SHAPE-IT, a pioneering AI-enabled shape display system, opens up a new realm of possibilities for on-demand, real-time, code-free dynamic shape authoring. By synergizing Generative AI (GPT4) with pin-based shape displays, SHAPE-IT allows users to articulate shapes, motion, and interaction using natural language inputs, demonstrating a significant stride toward making dynamic 3D shape rendering accessible and intuitive.
