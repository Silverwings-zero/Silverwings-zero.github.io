## Overview

Building upon the foundational work presented in the research paper titled "Learning to Write Stylized Chinese Characters by Reading a Handful of Examples" (link to the [original paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.08002.pdf)), this project takes a significant stride in advancing the quality of generated calligraphy writing. By ingeniously leveraging the stroke number of every character to adjust the number of parameters in the LM (Language Model) equation, a notable enhancement in the aesthetic and authenticity of the generated calligraphy writing is achieved.

## Objectives

The primary objectives of this extended project include:
- Optimizing the LM equation by varying the number of parameters based on the stroke number of each character.
- Achieving a higher level of quality and authenticity in generated calligraphy writing.
- Demonstrating the substantial impact of stroke number consideration on calligraphy generation.

## Methodology

By analyzing the stroke number of each character, a dynamic adjustment of the parameters in the LM equation is performed. This tailored approach ensures a more nuanced and accurate representation of each character, thus significantly elevating the quality of the generated calligraphy.

## Results

The results showcase a remarkable improvement in the quality of generated calligraphy writing, making a compelling case for the importance of stroke number optimization in enhancing calligraphy generation models. The extended work establishes a new benchmark in the realm of automated calligraphy generation, underscoring the potential of this method in contributing to the broader field of stylized character generation.

## Future Work

The success of this project opens up avenues for further research in dynamically adjusting model parameters based on intrinsic character attributes, which could be a game-changer in the domain of automated stylized writing generation.
