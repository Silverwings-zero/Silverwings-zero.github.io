Welcome to my personal website! I am Michael Qian, a Computer Science Ph.D. student at the University of Southern California. My research focuses on virtual haptic interactions and haptic rendering, with an emphasis on how people perceive and manipulate touch in interactive systems. Here, you will find an overview of my academic projects and research direction. Feel free to explore!

Here's a brief overview of my academic journey:
- Undergraduate studies: I completed my B.S. in Computer Science at the Georgia Institute of Technology 
- Graduate studies: 
    I completed my Predoctoral M.S. in Computer Science at the University of Chicago with Prof. Ken Nakagaki
    Currently pursuing my Ph.D. in Computer Science at the University of Southern California with Prof. [Heather Culbertson](https://viterbi.usc.edu/directory/faculty/Culbertson/Heather), focused on virtual haptic interactions and haptic rendering.
- Research Interests: Haptics, Virtual Haptic Interactions, Haptic Rendering, Multi-Modal Interactions, Robotics

Outside of research, I enjoy climbing and weightlifting, and I also spend time skiing when I can.
